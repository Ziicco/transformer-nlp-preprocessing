# Transformer-based NLP Preprocessing

## Description
This repository contains text preprocessing techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), leveraging **BERT-based Transformer models** and **PyTorch** to perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and contextualized token embeddings.

The project demonstrates how to:
- Tokenize text using the BERT tokenizer.
- Perform part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization.
- Remove stopwords and apply other preprocessing steps.
- Generate token and sentence embeddings using a pretrained Transformer model (BERT).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the code for basic text preprocessing:

1. **Tokenization and Embedding Generation**  
   You can preprocess any text input and generate embeddings with the following:

```python
import torch
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Download required NLTK resources
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Sample text
text = "This is an example sentence for advanced text preprocessing using Python and PyTorch!"

# Tokenization
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Generate contextualized embeddings
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=20)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**encoded_input)
    token_embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state

# Sentence embedding
sentence_embedding = token_embeddings[:, 0, :]  # [CLS] token representation
```

2. **Stopword Removal and Text Cleaning**  
   You can remove stopwords from tokenized text:

```python
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words and token not in tokenizer.all_special_tokens]
```
